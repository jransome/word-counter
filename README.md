# Word Counter

## Specification
Given a book in a text file (http://www.loyalbooks.com/download/text/Railway-Children-by-E-Nesbit.txt for example)

1.	Write an application that outputs the individual words that appear in the book, and how many times that word appears in the text file.
2.	The second part is to also output whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

The following assumptions can be made:
* Ignore punctuation and capitalisation
* TDD is expected

## Installation
* Instructions
* How to run tests

## Usage Instructions
* Include screenshot

## Approach
* structure
* issues faced

I began by translating the above specification into the following user stories:
```
As a user
So I can know what words appear in a given text
I want to see a list of the words that occur in the text

As a user
So I can know the frequency of a word's appearance in a given text
I want to see the word with the number of occurrences next to it

As a user
So I can know the frequency of a word's appearance in a given text is a prime number
I want the program to indicate if the number of occurrences of a word is a prime number or not
```

### Technologies used
